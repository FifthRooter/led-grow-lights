My vertical farming startup, although ultimately failed, was an incredible learning experience, and I got the opportunity to design a complete indoor vertical farming solution from the ground up, using custom designed enclosures, irrigation system, power and control electronics, as well as the LED grow lights themselves. This repo shows a part of the design process, including the end results. I've also attached the design files, though I don't recommend sending them to PCBWay and getting them made. They will work, but they were specifically designed for our farm design, and will result in an awkward installation and operation. Below images and videos demonstrate the designed lights, as well as LED driver board prototypes I made from scratch using PCB etching. At some point I'll add more, provide descriptions to everything.
